# dojo-appointment

This is an example project for creating an appointment booking REST
service, using mainly http-kit as ring compatible web server, and
compojure for request handling.

## Usage

After cloning the repository the easiest way to start a running service is
using the [lein-ring](https://github.com/weavejester/lein-ring) Leiningen
plugin. For this, you can go into the root directory of the project and start
up the server with the following command, which also opens browser on the start
page:

> lein ring server
